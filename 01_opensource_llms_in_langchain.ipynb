      "Okay, so I need to list all the stats of KL Rahul. Hmm, where do I start? I remember that KL Rahul is an Indian cricketer, so I should probably break down his stats by each format he's played inâ€”like Tests, ODIs, T20Is, and maybe even IPL since he's been involved in that too.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should figure out his batting stats. That means things like matches played, innings, runs scored, highest score, average, strike rate, centuries, half-centuries. Oh, and maybe his bowling stats too, although I think he's primarily a batsman. Wait, does he bowl? I think he's occasionally used as a part-time bowler, so I should check that.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Tests, I think he made his debut around 2014. Let me recall, he scored a century on debut, I believe. Maybe against Australia? As for his total runs, I'm not sure of the exact number, but I think he's in the range of 2,500 to 3,000 runs. His average is probably around 35, but I'm not certain. He has a few centuries, maybe 5 or 6? I remember him scoring a 199 once, so that's his highest score.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving to ODIs, he started around 2015 if I'm not wrong. His runs total might be around 1,500 to 2,000. Average could be mid-30s. Strike rate in ODIs is probably around 80. He might have a couple of centuries and several fifties. Maybe one or two hundreds?\n",
      "\n",
      "T20Is would have a lower number of matches, maybe around 50 or so. Runs might be in the 1,500 range. His strike rate here is probably higher, maybe around 135. He might have a couple of fifties but I don't recall him hitting many centuries in T20Is.\n",
      "\n",
      "IPL stats are important too. He plays for Lucknow Super Giants now, but before that, he was with Punjab. His total runs would be substantial, maybe around 3,000 runs. Average and strike rate would be higher in IPL, maybe averaging around 40 with a strike rate of 130+. He might have a century in IPL, perhaps more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bowling stats: He's not a regular bowler, so maybe just a few wickets across all formats. Maybe 2-3 wickets in Tests, a couple in ODIs, and one or two in T20Is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Awards and records: He might have won some Player of the Series awards. Also, he was the highest scorer in the IPL once, maybe in 2020 or 2021. I think he's also the fastest Indian to reach 1,000 runs in T20Is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personal info: Born in 1992, in Bangalore. His full name is Kannaur Lokesh Rahul. Nickname is KL. He bats right-handed and sometimes keeps wicket, especially in white-ball formats.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure all these stats are accurate. Maybe I'm mixing up some numbers, so I need to present them clearly without any confusion. Also, I should organize them by each format for clarity.\n",
